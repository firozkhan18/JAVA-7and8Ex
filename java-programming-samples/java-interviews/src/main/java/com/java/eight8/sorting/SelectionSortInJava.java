//Selection sort is a sorting algorithm which sorts the given array elements either in descending or ascending order by finding the misplaced element first and putting it in it’s final place. Selection sort algorithm first selects the lowest (or highest) element and places it in the ordered position. Selection sort is recommended only for small size arrays (less than 1000 elements). It doesn’t give much performance as compared to other sorting algorithms when used on large size arrays.

//In this post, we will see how the selection sort works, java program to implement selection sort and one example to demonstrate the selection sort.

//How The Selection Sort Works?
//Selection sort involves two things. One is the SELECTION – selecting the lowest (or highest) element and another one is the PLACEMENT – placing the element selected in the first step in an appropriate position. Selection sort first selects the lowest (or highest) element and exchanges it with the element in the first position. Then, again selects lowest (or highest) element in the remaining elements i.e in the elements between inputArray[1] and inputArray[n-1] and exchanges it with the element in the second position. This selection and placement is continued until all the elements are in the sorted order.
//
//Pseudocode For Selection Sort :

//selectionSort(int[] inputArray)
// 
//        for i = 0 to inputArray.length-1
// 
//                Select the lowest (or highest) element among inputArray[i] ....... inputArray[inputArray.length-1]
// 
//                Swap it with inputArray[i]
public class SelectionSortInJava {
	static void selectionSort(int[] inputArray) {
		int temp, pos;

		for (int i = 0; i < inputArray.length - 1; i++) {
			pos = i;
			// finding the position of smallest element between (i+1)th element and last
			// element
			for (int j = i + 1; j < inputArray.length; j++) {
				if (inputArray[j] < inputArray[pos]) {
					pos = j;
				}
			}
			// Swapping inputArray[i] and inputArray[pos]
			temp = inputArray[i];
			inputArray[i] = inputArray[pos];
			inputArray[pos] = temp;
		}

		for (int i = 0; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
			System.out.print(inputArray[i] + " ");
		}

		System.out.println();

		selectionSort(new int[] { 45, 84, 101, 62, 12, 45 });
		selectionSort(new int[] { 62, -45, 14, 8, -52, 45 });
		selectionSort(new int[] { 21, 12, 56, -48, 15, 45 });
