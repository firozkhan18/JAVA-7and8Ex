		//  Get a stream from the list of dishes by calling the stream method on menu.

		//Applying a function to each element of a stream
		
		//Streams support the method map, which takes a function as argument. The function is applied
		//to each element, mapping it into a new element (the word mapping is used because it has a
		//meaning similar to transforming but with the nuance of “creating a new version of” rather than
		//“modifying”). For example, in the following code you pass a method reference Dish::getName to
		//the map method to extract the names of the dishes in the stream:
			
		List<String> dishNames = menu.stream()
								.map(Dish::getName)
								.collect(toList());
		//Because the method getName returns a String, the stream outputted by the map method is of
		//type Stream<String>.
		System.out.println(dishNames);
		
		//The function to apply should take a word and return its length. You can solve this
		//problem as follows by passing a method reference String::length to map:
		
		List<String> words = Arrays.asList("Java8", "Lambdas", "In", "Action");
		List<Integer> wordLengths = words.stream()
									.map(String::length)
									.collect(toList());
		System.out.println(wordLengths);
		
		//What if you wanted 	to find out the length of the name of each dish? 
		//You could do this by chaining another map as follows:
		List<Integer> dishNameLengths = menu.stream()
										.map(Dish::getName)
										.map(String::length)
										.collect(toList());
		System.out.println(dishNameLengths);
		
		//Flattening streams
		//how could you return a list of all the unique characters for a list of words? 
		//For example, given the list of words ["Hello", "World"] you’d like to return the list ["H", "e", "l", "o", "W", "r", "d"].
		//You might think that this is easy, that you can just map each word into a list of characters and then call distinct to filter duplicate characters. 
		
		//A first go could be like this:
		words.stream()
			.map(word -> word.split(""))
			.distinct()
			.collect(toList());
		System.out.println(words);
//		The problem with this approach is that the lambda passed to the map method returns a String[]
//		(an array of String) for each word. So the stream returned by the map method is actually of type
//		Stream<String[]>. What you really want is Stream<String> to represent a stream of characters.
		words.stream()
			.map(word -> word.split(""))
			.map(Arrays::stream)
			.distinct()
			.collect(toList());
		System.out.println(words);
//		The current solution still doesn’t work! This is because you now end up with a list of streams
//		(more precisely, Stream<Stream<String>>)! Indeed, you first convert each word into an array
//		of its individual letters and then make each array into a separate stream.
		//Using flatMap
		//You can fix this problem by using flatMap as follows:
		List<String> uniqueCharacter = words.stream()
										.map(word -> word.split(""))
										.flatMap(Arrays::stream)
										.distinct()
										.collect(toList());
		System.out.println(uniqueCharacter);
		
	//	Using the flatMap method has the effect of mapping each array not with a stream but with the
	//	contents of that stream. All the separate streams that were generated when using
	//	map(Arrays::stream) get amalgamated—flattened into a single stream.
		
		
	//	Given a list of numbers, how would you return a list of the square of each number? For
	//	example, given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] you should return [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].
		
	//	You can solve this problem by using map with a lambda that takes a number and returns the
	//	square of the number:
		List<Integer> numbers1 = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
		List<Integer> squares = numbers1.stream()
								.map(n -> n * n)
								.collect(toList());
		System.out.println(squares);
		
	//	Given two lists of numbers, how would you return all pairs of numbers? For example, given a
	//	list [1, 2, 3] and a list [3, 4] you should return [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. For
	//	simplicity, you can represent a pair as an array with two elements.
		
	//	You could use two maps to iterate on the two lists and generate the pairs. But this would return
	//	a Stream<Stream<Integer[]>>. What you need to do is flatten the generated streams to result in
	//	a Stream<Integer[]>. This is what flatMap is for:
		
		List<Integer> numbers2 = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
		List<Integer> numbers3 = Arrays.asList(3, 4);
		List<int[]> pairs = numbers2.stream()
							.flatMap(i -> numbers3.stream()
							.map(j -> new int[]{i, j}))
							.collect(toList());
		
		System.out.println(pairs);
		
	//	How would you extend the previous example to return only pairs whose sum is divisible by 3?
	//	For example, (2, 4) and (3, 3) are valid.
		
	//	You saw earlier that filter can be used with a predicate to filter elements from a stream. Because
	//	after the flatMap operation you have a stream of int[] that represent a pair, you just need a
	//	predicate to check to see if the sum is divisible by 3:
		
		List<Integer> numbers4 = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
		List<Integer> numbers5 = Arrays.asList(3, 4);
		List<int[]> pairs2 = numbers4.stream()
							.flatMap(i ->numbers5.stream()
							.filter(j -> (i + j) % 3 == 0)
							.map(j -> new int[]{i, j}))
							.collect(toList());
		
		System.out.println(pairs2);
		
	//	Checking to see if a predicate matches all elements
	//	The allMatch method works similarly to anyMatch but will check to see if all the elements of the
	//	stream match the given predicate. For example, you can use it to find out whether the menu is
	//	healthy (that is, all dishes are below 1000 calories):
		
		boolean isHealthy = menu.stream()
		.allMatch(d -> d.getCalories() < 1000);
		
		System.out.println(isHealthy);
		
		//noneMatch
	//	The opposite of allMatch is noneMatch. It ensures that no elements in the stream match the
	//	given predicate. For example, you could rewrite the previous example as follows using
	//	noneMatch:
		boolean isHealthy1 = menu.stream()
		.noneMatch(d -> d.getCalories() >= 1000);
	//	These three operations, anyMatch, allMatch, and noneMatch, make use of what we call
	//	short-circuiting, a stream version of the familiar Java short-circuiting && and || operators.
		System.out.println(isHealthy1);
		
	//	Finding an element
	//	The findAny method returns an arbitrary element of the current stream. It can be used in
	//	conjunction with other stream operations. For example, you may wish to find a dish that’s
	//	vegetarian. You can combine the filter method and findAny to express this query:
		
		Optional<Dish> dish = menu.stream()
				.filter(Dish::isVegetarian)
				.findAny();
		System.out.println(dish);
		
	//	Finding the first element
	//	Some streams have an encounter order that specifies the order in which items logically appear
	//	in the stream (for example, a stream generated from a List or from a sorted sequence of data).
	//	For such streams you may wish to find the first element. There’s the findFirst method for this,
	//	which works similarly to findAny. For example, the code that follows, given a list of numbers,
	//	finds the first square that’s divisible by 3:
		
		List<Integer> someNumbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
		Optional<Integer> firstSquareDivisibleByThree =  someNumbers.stream()
														.map(x -> x * x)
														.filter(x -> x % 3 == 0)
														.findFirst(); // 9
		System.out.println(firstSquareDivisibleByThree);
		
	//	When to use findFirst and findAny
	//	You may wonder why we have both findFirst and findAny. The answer is parallelism. Finding
	//	the first element is more constraining in parallel. If you don’t care about which element is
	//	returned, use findAny because it’s less constraining when using parallel streams.
		
	//	Reducing
	//	So far, the terminal operations you’ve seen return a boolean (allMatch and so on), void
	//	(forEach), or an Optional object (findAny and so on). You’ve also been using collect to combine
	//	all elements in a stream into a List.
		
	//	Summing the elements
	//	Before we investigate how to use the reduce method, it helps to first see how you’d sum the
	//	elements of a list of numbers using a for-each loop:
		int sum = 0;
		for (int x : numbers) {
			sum += x;
		}
	//	Each element of numbers is combined iteratively with the addition operator to form a result.
	//	You reduce the list of numbers into one number by repeatedly using addition.
	//	There are two parameters in this code:
	//	The initial value of the sum variable, in this case 0
	//	The operation to combine all the elements of the list, in this case +
		
	//	You can sum all the elements of a stream as follows:
		int sum1 = numbers.stream().reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
		
	//	reduce takes two arguments:
	//	An initial value, here 0.
	//	A BinaryOperator<T> to combine two elements and produce a new value; here you use the lambda (a, b) -> a + b.
	//	You could just as easily multiply all the elements by passing a different lambda, (a, b) -> a * b, to
	//	the reduce operation:
		
		int product1 = numbers.stream().reduce(1, (a, b) -> a * b);
		
	//  Using reduce to sum the numbers in a stream
		
	//	Let’s take an in-depth look into how the reduce operation happens to sum a stream of numbers.
	//	First, 0 is used as the first parameter of the lambda (a), and 4 is consumed from the stream and used as the second parameter (b). 
	//	0 + 4 produces 4, and it becomes the new accumulated value.
	//	Then the lambda is called again with the accumulated value and the next element of the stream, 5, which produces the new accumulated value, 9. 
	//	Moving forward, the lambda is called again with the accumulated value and the next element, 3, which produces 12. 
	//	Finally, the lambda is called with 12 and the last element of the stream, 9, which produces the final value, 21.
	//	You can make this code more concise by using a method reference. In Java 8 the Integer class now comes with a static sum method to add two numbers, which is just what you want instead
	//	of repeatedly writing out the same code as lambda:
		
		int sum2 = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
		
//		No initial value
//		There’s also an overloaded variant of reduce that doesn’t take an initial value, but it returns an
//		Optional object:
		
		Optional<Integer> sum3 = numbers.stream().reduce((a, b) -> (a + b));
		
//		Why does it return an Optional<Integer>? Consider the case when the stream contains no
//		elements. The reduce operation can’t return a sum because it doesn’t have an initial value. This
//		is why the result is wrapped in an Optional object to indicate that the sum may be absent. Now
//		see what else you can do with reduce.
		
//		A reduce operation—calculating the maximum
		Optional<Integer> max = numbers.stream().reduce(Integer::max);
		
//		To calculate the minimum, you need to pass Integer.min to the reduce operation instead of
//		Integer.max:
		Optional<Integer> min = numbers.stream().reduce(Integer::min);
//		You could have equally well used the lambda (x,y)->x<y?x:y instead of Integer::min, but the
//		latter is easier to read.
		
//		How would you count the number of dishes in a stream using the map and reduce methods?
		
//		You can solve this problem by mapping each element of a stream into the number 1 and then
//		summing them using reduce! This is equivalent to counting in order the number of elements in
//		the stream.
		
		int count1 = menu.stream()
				.map(d -> 1)
				.reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
		System.out.println(count1);
		
//		The built-in method count to count the number of elements in the stream:
		long count2 = menu.stream().count();
		
		
//		Benefit of the reduce method and parallelism
		
//		The benefit of using reduce compared to the step-by-step iteration summation that you wrote earlier is that the iteration is abstracted using internal iteration, which enables the internal
//		implementation to choose to perform the reduce operation in parallel.
		
//		The iterative summation example involves shared updates to a sum variable, which doesn’t parallelize gracefully. 
		
//		If you add in the needed synchronization, you’ll likely discover that thread contention robs you of all the performance that parallelism was supposed to give you! Parallelizing this computation requires a different approach: partition the input, sum the partitions, and combine the sums.
//		But now the code is starting to look really different. 
		
//		You’ll see what this looks like in chapter 7 using the fork/join framework. But for now it’s important to realize that the mutable
//		accumulator pattern is a dead end for parallelization. You need a new pattern, and this is what reduce provides you. 
//		You’ll also see in chapter 7 that to sum all the elements in parallel using streams, there’s almost no modification to your code: stream() becomes parallelStream():
		int sum4 = numbers.parallelStream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
		
		//Numeric streams
		//calculate the number of calories in the menu as follows:
		int calories = menu.stream()
						.map(Dish::getCalories)
						.reduce(0, Integer::sum);
		System.out.println(calories);
		
//		int calories1 = menu.stream()
//				.map(Dish::getCalories)
//				.sum();
		
		IntStream intStream = menu.stream().mapToInt(Dish::getCalories);
		System.out.println(intStream);
		Stream<Integer> stream = intStream.boxed();
		System.out.println(stream);
		
//		Optional class, which is a container that indicates the presence or absence of a value. 
//		Optional can be parameterized with reference types such as Integer, String, and so on. 
//		There’s a primitive specialized version of Optional as well for the three primitive stream specializations: 
//		OptionalInt, OptionalDouble, and OptionalLong.
		
		//find the maximal element of an IntStream by calling the max method, which returns an OptionalInt:
		OptionalInt maxCalories = menu.stream()
									.mapToInt(Dish::getCalories)
									.max();
		
		//You can now process the OptionalInt explicitly to define a default value if there’s no maximum:
		int max1 = maxCalories.orElse(1);
		
		//Numeric ranges
		
//		Java 8 introduces two static methods available on IntStream and LongStream to help generate such ranges: 
//		range and rangeClosed. 
//		Both methods take the starting value of the range as the first parameter and the end value of the range as the second parameter. 
//		But range is exclusive, whereas rangeClosed is inclusive.
		
//		Let’s look at an example:
		IntStream evenNumbers = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 100).filter(n -> n % 2 ==0);
		System.out.println(evenNumbers.count());
		//Generating tuples
//		stream.filter(b -> Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b) % 1 == 0)
//		.map(b -> new int[]{a, b, (int) Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)});

		//Generating b values
//		IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 100)
//		.filter(b -> Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b) % 1 == 0)
//		.boxed()
//		.map(b -> new int[]{a, b, (int) Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)});
		
//		IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 100)
//		.filter(b -> Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b) % 1 == 0)
//		.mapToObj(b -> new int[]{a, b, (int) Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)});
		
		//Generating a values		
		Stream<int[]> pythagoreanTriples1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 100).boxed()
											.flatMap(a -> IntStream.rangeClosed(a, 100)
											.filter(b -> Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b) % 1 == 0)
											.mapToObj(b -> new int[]{a, b, (int)Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)}));
		//System.out.println(pythagoreanTriples1.count());
		pythagoreanTriples1.limit(5).forEach(t ->System.out.println(t[0] + ", " + t[1] + ", " + t[2]));
//		First, you create a numeric range from 1 to 100 to generate
//		values for a. For each given value of a you’re creating a stream of triples. Mapping a value of a to
//		a stream of triples would result in a stream of streams! The flatMap method does the mapping
//		and also flattens all the generated streams of triples into a single stream. As a result you produce
//		a stream of triples. Note also that you change the range of b to be a to 100. There’s no need to
//		start the range at the value 1 because this would create duplicate triples (for example, (3, 4, 5)
//		and (4, 3, 5)).
		
		Stream<double[]> pythagoreanTriples3 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 100).boxed()
												.flatMap(a -> IntStream.rangeClosed(a, 100)				
												.mapToObj(b -> new double[]{a, b, (int)Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)})
												.filter(t -> t[2] % 1 == 0));
		System.out.println(pythagoreanTriples3.count());
		
//		Streams from values
//		You can create a stream with explicit values by using the static method Stream.of, which can
//		take any number of parameters. For example, in the following code you create a stream of
//		strings directly using Stream.of. You then convert the strings to uppercase before printing them
//		one by one:
		Stream<String> stream1 = Stream.of("Java 8 ", "Lambdas ", "In ", "Action");
		stream1.map(String::toUpperCase).forEach(System.out::println);
//		You can get an empty stream using the empty method as follows:
		Stream<String> emptyStream = Stream.empty();
		
//		Streams from arrays
		int[] numbers6 = {2,3,5,7,11,13};
		int sum5 = Arrays.stream(numbers6).sum();
		System.out.println(sum5);
		//Iterate
		//This code will produce the Fibonacci series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34....
		Stream.iterate(new int[]{0, 1}, t -> new int[]{t[1],t[0] + t[1]})
				.limit(10)
				.map(t -> t[0])
				.forEach(System.out::println);
		//Generate
		Stream.generate(Math::random)
				.limit(5)
				.forEach(System.out::println);
		
		//Collecting data with streams
		
//		Finding maximum and minimum in a stream of values
		
//		Suppose you want to find the highest-calorie dish in the menu. You can use two collectors,
//		Collectors.maxBy and Collectors.minBy, to calculate the maximum or minimum value in a stream. 
//		These two collectors take a Comparator as argument to compare the elements in the stream. 
//		Here you create a Comparator comparing dishes based on their calorie content and pass it to Collectors.maxBy:
		Comparator<Dish> dishCaloriesComparator = Comparator.comparingInt(Dish::getCalories);
		Optional<Dish> mostCalorieDish = menu.stream()
										.collect(maxBy(dishCaloriesComparator));
		System.out.println(mostCalorieDish);
		
//		find the total number of calories in your menu list with
		int totalCalories = menu.stream().collect(summingInt(Dish::getCalories));
		System.out.println(totalCalories);
//		The Collectors.summingLong and Collectors.summingDouble methods behave exactly the same way and can be used where the field to be summed is respectively a long or a double.
		
//		But there’s more to summarization than mere summing; also available is a
//		Collectors .averagingInt, together with its averagingLong and averagingDouble counterparts, to
//		calculate the average of the same set of numeric values:
		double avgCalories = menu.stream().collect(averagingInt(Dish::getCalories));
		System.out.println(avgCalories);
		
		int totalCalories1 = menu.stream().map(Dish::getCalories).reduce(Integer::sum).get();
		System.out.println(totalCalories1);
		
		int totalCalories2 = menu.stream().mapToInt(Dish::getCalories).sum();
		System.out.println(totalCalories2);
		
		IntSummaryStatistics menuStatistics = menu.stream().collect(summarizingInt(Dish::getCalories));
		System.out.println(menuStatistics);
		
//		Joining Strings
//		This means you can concatenate the names of all the dishes in the menu as follows:
		String shortMenu = menu.stream().map(Dish::getName).collect(joining());
		System.out.println(shortMenu);
		
//		You’d obtain the same result without needing to map over the original stream with a function
//		extracting the name from each dish:
//		String shortMenu1 = menu.stream().collect(joining());
//		System.out.println(shortMenu1);
		
//		Fortunately, the joining factory method has an overloaded version
//		that accepts a delimiter string between two consecutive elements, so you can obtain a
//		comma-separated list of the dishes’ names with
		String shortMenu2 = menu.stream().map(Dish::getName).collect(joining(", "));
		System.out.println(shortMenu2);	
		
//		Generalized summarization with reduction

		Stream<Dish> menuStream = menu.stream();
		List<Dish> dishes2 = menuStream.collect(new ToListCollector<Dish>());
		System.out.println(dishes2);
//		Characteristics method
		
//		Characteristics, returns an immutable set of Characteristics, defining the behavior of the collector—in particular providing hints about whether the stream can be reduced
//		in parallel and which optimizations are valid when doing so.
		
//		Characteristics is an enumeration containing three items:
		
//		 UNORDERED—The result of the reduction isn’t affected by the order in which the items in the stream are traversed and accumulated.
//		 CONCURRENT—The accumulator function can be called concurrently from multiple threads, and then this collector can perform a parallel reduction of the stream. 
//		If the collector isn’t also flagged as UNORDERED, it can perform a parallel reduction only when it’s applied to an unordered data source.
//		 IDENTITY_FINISH—This indicates the function returned by the finisher method is the identity one, and its application can be omitted. 
//		In this case, the accumulator object is directly used as the final result of the reduction process. This also implies that it’s safe to do an unchecked cast from the accumulator A to the result R.
		
//		In Java 8, Function.identity() is a static method in the java.util.function package that returns a Function that always returns its input argument.
//		This method is useful when you want to transform or map elements in a stream using a lambda expression but want to achieve a pass-through behavior in certain cases.
//		Here is an example code that demonstrates the usage of Function.identity():
		List<String> names3 = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");

        // Using Function.identity() to perform a pass-through transformation
        List<String> transformedNames = names3.stream()
						                .map(Function.identity())
						                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        // Output the transformedNames
